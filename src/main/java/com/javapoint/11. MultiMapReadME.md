# MultiValueMap


By definition, a Multimap refers to that a every input is associated with at least one output. 
On the contrary, a Map has a value that correspond just to ONE of the other value.


A MultiValueMap decorates another map, allowing it to have more than one value for a key.
A MultiMap is a Map with slightly different semantics. 

Putting a value into the map will add the value to a Collection at that key. 
Getting a value will return a Collection, holding all the values put to that key.

In addition, this implementation allows the type of collection used for the values to be controlled. 

By default, an ArrayList is used, however a Class to instantiate may be specified, or a factory that returns a Collection instance.

Note that MultiValueMap is not synchronized and is not thread-safe. 

If you wish to use this map from multiple threads concurrently, you must use appropriate synchronization. This class may throw exceptions when accessed by concurrent threads without synchronization.
